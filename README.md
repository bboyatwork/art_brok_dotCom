# Arthur Brock's Personal Web Site

This is the source code repository for [Arthur's web site](http://artbrock.com).  

It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to produce static HTML pages served out by [GitHub](http://github.com) 

Also, there *should* be Disqus discussions on each post for you to **post comments**.

[Let me know]() if anything would make this site more useful.
