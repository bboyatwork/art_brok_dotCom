### The Future of Governance is not Governments
Sunday May 28th, 2017

Metacurrency co-founder Arthur Brock argues that our governmental institutions don't have the bandwidth to keep up with a world that is changing as rapidly as ours is and suggests that we need to create new governance mechanisms using bottom-up, digital social networks.  

The [article is a short read](https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/the-future-of-governance-is-not-governments-9c894e17b1cd). Please bring comments or questions to this 90 minute online salon so we can explore this terrain together.

### The Right to be Forgotten
Sunday May 13th, 2017

Inspired by Maciej Cegłowski’s [recent suggestion](http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm) that we “teach social software to forget, to give it predictable security properties, and to sever the financial connection between online advertising and extremism.”
