## Summer 2017 Residencies
*San Francisco CA*

At Ceptr we're building a platform for distributed applications that will power new forms of human collaboration and help the world successfully navigate the daunting challenges we face. Designed using the organizational patterns found in nature, we're opening new possibilities for more more equitable and regenerative forms of governance and wealth creation.

You don't program? Cool! Because the project needs all sorts of skills; storytellers, marketeers, organizers, community developers and more.

[Apply Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRsdhzd1Wkfe0GA0_gfyJiuZ6bVUust5uLkZqDNeeO8G2wNg/viewform?usp=sf_link){:class="btn btn-primary btn-xl page-scroll"}

We are looking for summer residents to join our team as we build and launch initial applications, share discoveries, and grow a movement that will change the planet.

As a Resident of the Ceptr team you will help awaken people's minds to possibilities that they've never imagined and create the tools that will make that future a reality.

As an Open Source project, Ceptr is not a profit-driven organization and has no short-term revenue. Most people participate as volunteers. We operate as a "do-acracy," empowering people to participate in whatever ways they see fit within self-directed teams.

![Residency House](/images/OceanView.jpg){:class="col-xl-6 col-lg-6 col-md-6"}We are implementing new ways of recognizing the contributions of our community members and supporting them and their growth.

Residencies include room and board. There will be domain-specific teams located in San Francisco(CA), Albuquerque(NM), and Ashland(OR).

More important than specific job skills or experience is communication, competence and commitment. We can provide training and development on particular skills, although it is also great if you’re already bringing some good ones.

If selected, this could easily become a career path as most will advance toward positions of leadership or take their training out into the world to start their own entrepreneurial ventures.
