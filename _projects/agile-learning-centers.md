[Agile Learning Centers](http://agilelearningcenters.org/) are a rapidly-spreading, new model for education that enables schools to adapt to and serve the learning journey of their students, and provide an education that nourishes self-authorship, creativity, and entrepreneurship. ALCs bring agile practices and intentional culture development to a domain (education) that has been mired in bureaucracy and stuck in the assembly line practices of the industrial age.
