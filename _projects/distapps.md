   <b>Stage of Development:</b> Spec & Design. Waiting for Alpha launch of [Holochain](/projects/holochain) to begin development
</div>

## Overview

This sub-project is best understood as a development phase when we will be boot-strapping a number of applications using [Holochains](/projects/holochain) & [Pcubed](/projects/pcubed).  This will demonstrate composing with holochains and how that technology provides [edge computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing).

## Apps Ecosystem
These are some of the applications that support an edge-hosted application ecosystem, and that we want for our own project, so we will be developing them in this phase of the project.
