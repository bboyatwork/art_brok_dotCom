      <strong>BRIEF BIO: </strong>Arthur Brock builds targeted currencies which shape the social dynamics of our emerging post-industrial economy. He has created more than a hundred designs for multi-currency systems and his software company has built and deployed dozens of those systems. </p><p>Initially, Arthur put his experience Artificial Intelligence to use at GM, Chrysler &amp; Hughes, but shifted his focus to building intelligence into social architectures rather than to computers. He started student-run schools and award-winning, employee-run businesses and discovered the engine that runs these types of organizations involve specific patterns of incentives and feedback. He began to unlock secrets of the Social DNA by which people operate and the critical role of currencies for programming these patterns.&nbsp;</p><p>Arthurâ€™s designs include currency systems for: collaborative scientific research, sustainable fishery management, corporate compensation plans, employee stock options, community-based economic development, business barter and exchange, triple-bottom-line trade credits, open source software development, customer loyalty programs, water rights, recirculating gift certificates, community service, employee performance management, arts &amp; culture development, efficient resource sharing &amp; management, and community &amp; environmental impact assessment.</p><p>Based in New York City, Arthur Brock consults worldwide with organizations which are actively restructuring themselves for the new economy.</p>
