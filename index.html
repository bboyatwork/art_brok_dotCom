        <h3>A Living Systems Model of Wealth</h3>
        <p>Money is a terrible measure of value. In the same way that most of the value you have to offer, is simply not accessible through dollars, our economy fails to access and enable the bulk of the value around us. Until we create currencies which recognize value flows at all these levels, we perpetuate intolerable poverty. This isn't a poverty of inequitable distribution, but a poverty of measurement.</p>

        <h3>Emerging Leader Labs - Seed Project</h3>
        <p>I really haven't had a chance to update my web site with any information about my most recent life-consuming project: <a href = "http://www.emergingleaderlabs.org/">Emerging Leader Labs</a>. We're creating a template for social impact incubators to flourish outside of the monetary economy.<br> <br> One of our participants captured the spirit of the project pretty darn well in this new video he just made. Yay Ben!</p>

        <h3>New Economy, New Wealth Prezi</h3>
        <p>The following presentation I made has been rather popular. It depicts where we are in the evolution of economies and provides some insights about what is changing and where we're going.</p>

        <h3>Arthur Brock & Eric Harris-Braun speak at Occupy Wall St</h3>
        <p>Expanding on the Living Systems Model of wealth above, you can hear us talk about it at Occupy Wall Street. The real potential of OWS is clearly not about physical occupation of a street, but about occupying the role that Wall St. has played in wealth creation. We spoke as part of Re-Visioning Money Day on October 24, 2011 at 60 Wall St.</p>

      <strong>BRIEF BIO: </strong>Arthur Brock builds targeted currencies which shape the social dynamics of our emerging post-industrial economy. He has created more than a hundred designs for multi-currency systems and his software company has built and deployed dozens of those systems. </p><p>Initially, Arthur put his experience Artificial Intelligence to use at GM, Chrysler &amp; Hughes, but shifted his focus to building intelligence into social architectures rather than to computers. He started student-run schools and award-winning, employee-run businesses and discovered the engine that runs these types of organizations involve specific patterns of incentives and feedback. He began to unlock secrets of the Social DNA by which people operate and the critical role of currencies for programming these patterns.&nbsp;</p><p>Arthurâ€™s designs include currency systems for: collaborative scientific research, sustainable fishery management, corporate compensation plans, employee stock options, community-based economic development, business barter and exchange, triple-bottom-line trade credits, open source software development, customer loyalty programs, water rights, recirculating gift certificates, community service, employee performance management, arts &amp; culture development, efficient resource sharing &amp; management, and community &amp; environmental impact assessment.</p><p>Based in New York City, Arthur Brock consults worldwide with organizations which are actively restructuring themselves for the new economy.</p>
